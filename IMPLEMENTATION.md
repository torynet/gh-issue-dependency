# Trunk-Based Release System Implementation

## âœ… Implementation Complete

This repository now has a fully implemented trunk-based development workflow with conventional commits and automated release management.

## ðŸš€ System Overview

### Workflow
```
feature/123-branch â†’ PR â†’ squash merge to main â†’ RC tag â†’ beta build â†’ [MANUAL GATE] â†’ release tag â†’ production build
```

### Key Components Implemented

#### 1. GitHub Actions Workflows
- **`trunk-release.yml`** - Main release pipeline with RC creation and manual gate
- **`ci.yml`** - Enhanced with branch name and PR title validation  
- **`release.yml`** - Updated for production releases (excludes RC tags)

#### 2. Branch Management
- **Naming Convention**: `(feature|hotfix|epic)/123-description`
- **Validation**: Automatic validation on PR creation
- **Issue Integration**: PR titles must include issue numbers

#### 3. Commit System
- **Hook Installed**: Automatic issue number injection from branch names
- **Conventional Commits**: `feat:`, `fix:`, `perf:` with breaking change support
- **Version Bumping**: Semantic versioning based on commit types

#### 4. Release Process
- **RC Tags**: `v1.2.0-rc1` for beta builds
- **Release Tags**: `v1.2.0` for production builds  
- **Manual Gate**: GitHub Environment `release-approval` for controlled releases
- **Build Types**: Beta (`-X cmd.BuildType=beta`) and Release (`-X cmd.BuildType=release`)

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

### Required GitHub Configuration

1. **Create Environment**:
   - Go to Settings â†’ Environments â†’ New environment
   - Name: `release-approval`
   - Add required reviewers (release managers)
   - Deployment branches: `main` only

2. **Branch Protection**:
   - Protect `main` branch
   - Require status checks: `validate-branch`, `validate-pr-title`, `test`, `lint`
   - Require branches up to date before merging

### Team Onboarding

1. **Install Hooks**: Run `./scripts/install-hooks.sh` (already done locally)
2. **Branch Naming**: Use `feature/123-add-feature` format
3. **PR Process**: Fill out breaking changes section when applicable
4. **Merge Process**: Use squash merge with conventional commit messages

## ðŸ§ª Testing the System

### Test the Commit Hook
```bash
# Create a test branch
git checkout -b feature/999-test-commit-hook

# Make a commit (hook should add #999: prefix)
echo "test" >> test.txt
git add test.txt
git commit -m "Add test file"
# Should become: "#999: Add test file"
```

### Test Branch Validation
```bash
# Create PR with properly formatted branch and title
# Branch: feature/999-test-commit-hook  
# PR Title: "999: Test the new trunk-based workflow"
```

### Test Release Process
```bash
# Make a conventional commit on main (via squash merge)
# Example: "feat: add new awesome feature"
# Should trigger RC creation: v1.0.0-rc1
# Manual approval creates release tag: v1.0.0
```

## ðŸ“š Documentation

- **Full System Docs**: `D:\resources\trunk-based-release-system.md`
- **PR Template**: Guides contributors through proper formatting
- **Commit Lint**: Validates conventional commit format
- **Release Rules**: Semantic versioning configuration

## ðŸŽ¯ Benefits Achieved
