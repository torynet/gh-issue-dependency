# 🚨 IMMEDIATE: GitHub Rulesets Setup Required

## Quick Setup Checklist

To complete the trunk-based development setup, you need to configure GitHub rulesets **immediately**:

### 1. Main Branch Protection (CRITICAL)

Go to **Settings** → **Rules** → **Rulesets** → **New ruleset**:

**Basic Configuration:**
- Name: `Main Branch Protection`
- Status: ✅ Active
- Target: Branch pattern `main`

**Essential Rules:**
- ✅ **Restrict pushes** (nobody can push directly)
- ✅ **Require pull requests** 
- ✅ **Require status checks to pass**
- ✅ **Require branches to be up to date**

**Required Status Checks** (add these exactly):
```
CI / validate-branch
CI / validate-pr-title
CI / test
CI / lint
CI / security-scan
Auto-Squash Conventional Commits / generate-conventional-commit
```

### 2. Release Approval Environment

Go to **Settings** → **Environments** → **New environment**:

- Name: `release-approval`
- Required reviewers: Add yourself
- Deployment branches: `main` only

### 3. Verify Setup

Test that direct pushes are blocked:
```bash
# This should be rejected:
git checkout main
git push origin main
```

## Why This Is Critical

**Without rulesets:**
- ❌ Anyone can push directly to main (bypassing CI/CD)
- ❌ No PR reviews required 
- ❌ Tests can be bypassed
- ❌ Releases can happen without approval

**With rulesets:**
- ✅ All changes go through PR review process
- ✅ CI/CD validation is mandatory
- ✅ Conventional commits are enforced
- ✅ Releases require approval gates

## Current Status

Your trunk-based workflows are deployed but **not enforced** until rulesets are active.

See `docs/development/github-rulesets-setup.md` for detailed instructions.
