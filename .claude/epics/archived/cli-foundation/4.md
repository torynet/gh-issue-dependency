# Task: Create command stubs for list, add, remove

## Description
Create stub implementations for the three main commands (list, add, remove) following gh-sub-issue's command organization patterns. Each command will have proper Cobra structure with argument validation but no business logic implementation yet.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] cmd/list.go created with proper Cobra command structure
- [ ] cmd/add.go created with proper Cobra command structure  
- [ ] cmd/remove.go created with proper Cobra command structure
- [ ] Each command registered with root command via init() functions
- [ ] Proper argument validation using cobra.ExactArgs() or similar
- [ ] Help text and usage examples for each command
- [ ] Commands return "not implemented yet" message when executed
- [ ] All commands follow consistent naming and flag patterns

## Technical Details
- **Implementation approach**: Mirror gh-sub-issue command file structure exactly
- **Key considerations**: Consistent init() pattern, proper argument validation, placeholder implementations
- **Code locations**: cmd/list.go, cmd/add.go, cmd/remove.go

Command signatures to implement:
```bash
gh-issue-dependency list <issue-number>
gh-issue-dependency add <issue-number> --blocked-by <issue> OR --blocks <issue>
gh-issue-dependency remove <issue-number> --blocked-by <issue> OR --blocks <issue>
```

Each command file should include:
- Cobra command variable definition
- init() function to register with root command
- Placeholder RunE function that returns "not implemented" error
- Proper help text with usage examples

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 002 completed (root command structure exists)
- [ ] Understanding of gh-sub-issue command patterns
- [ ] Cobra framework properly initialized

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 2-3 hours
- Parallel: false (requires root command foundation)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] `go run main.go list --help` shows proper help for list command
- [ ] `go run main.go add --help` shows proper help for add command
- [ ] `go run main.go remove --help` shows proper help for remove command
- [ ] All commands accept correct argument counts and show validation errors
- [ ] Help text includes usage examples and flag descriptions
- [ ] Commands execute but show "not implemented yet" messages
- [ ] Code structure matches gh-sub-issue command organization patterns
