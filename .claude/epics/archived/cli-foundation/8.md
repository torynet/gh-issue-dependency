# Task: Implement comprehensive help system and documentation

## Description
Complete the help system and documentation following gh CLI standards exactly. Ensure all help text, usage examples, and error guidance meet GitHub CLI extension conventions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Root command help shows proper project description and command list
- [ ] Each subcommand has detailed help with usage examples
- [ ] Flag descriptions are comprehensive with default values shown
- [ ] Error guidance included in help text for common scenarios
- [ ] README.md updated with installation and usage instructions
- [ ] Help text formatting matches standard gh CLI conventions exactly
- [ ] Usage examples demonstrate typical workflows
- [ ] All help content is accurate and actionable

## Technical Details
- **Implementation approach**: Follow gh CLI help formatting standards exactly
- **Key considerations**: Consistent formatting, comprehensive examples, accurate descriptions
- **Code locations**: cmd/*.go help text, README.md

Help system components to complete:
- **Root command**: Project overview, available commands, global flags
- **List command**: Usage examples, output format descriptions
- **Add command**: Relationship types, flag combinations, validation rules  
- **Remove command**: Safety considerations, confirmation behavior
- **Error scenarios**: Authentication, permissions, invalid inputs

README.md sections to include:
- Project description and goals
- Installation instructions (go install, gh extension install)
- Usage examples for all commands
- Authentication setup requirements
- Troubleshooting common issues

Help text format standards:
```text
gh-issue-dependency - Manage GitHub issue dependencies

USAGE
  gh issue-dependency [command]

AVAILABLE COMMANDS
  list     List issue dependencies
  add      Add dependency relationships  
  remove   Remove dependency relationships

FLAGS
  -R, --repo OWNER/REPO   Select repository using OWNER/REPO format
```

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 006 completed (testing infrastructure validates help text)
- [ ] All command stubs have basic help text structure
- [ ] Understanding of gh CLI help formatting standards

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 1-2 hours
- Parallel: false (requires completed foundation to document)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All subcommand help text is detailed and includes examples
- [ ] README.md provides complete installation and usage guide
- [ ] Help text formatting exactly matches gh CLI standards
- [ ] All usage examples are tested and accurate
- [ ] Error scenarios are documented with resolution steps
- [ ] Documentation is ready for end users and contributors
