# Task: Create comprehensive testing and validation suite

## Description
Implement comprehensive testing coverage including unit tests for output formatting, API integration testing, and end-to-end validation with real GitHub data. Ensure performance benchmarks and error handling scenarios are thoroughly tested.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit tests for all output formatting functions (TTY, plain text, JSON)
- [ ] API integration tests with mocked GitHub responses
- [ ] End-to-end integration tests with real GitHub repositories
- [ ] Performance testing for command execution time (< 2 seconds target)
- [ ] Error handling tests for authentication, permissions, rate limiting
- [ ] Edge case testing (empty dependencies, large lists, cross-repo scenarios)
- [ ] Test coverage report showing adequate coverage (>80%)

## Technical Details
- **Implementation approach**: Follow gh-sub-issue testing patterns with table-driven tests
- **Key considerations**: Mock GitHub API responses, performance benchmarks, edge cases
- **Code locations**: cmd/list_test.go, pkg/github_test.go, pkg/output_test.go, tests/integration_test.sh

Unit test examples:
```go
func TestFormatTTYOutput(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name     string
        input    *DependencyData
        expected string
    }{
        {
            name: "single blocked by dependency",
            input: &DependencyData{
                BlockedBy: []DependencyRelation{
                    {
                        Issue: Issue{Number: 45, Title: "Setup", State: "open"},
                        Type: "blocked_by",
                    },
                },
            },
            expected: "BLOCKED BY (1 issue)\nâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€\nðŸ”µ #45   Setup     [open]",
        },
        // More test cases...
    }
    
    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            result := formatTTYOutput(tt.input)
            assert.Contains(t, result, tt.expected)
        })
    }
}
```

Integration test scenarios:
- Command execution with valid issue numbers
- Cross-repository dependency handling
- State filtering functionality
- JSON output with field selection
- Error handling for invalid inputs
- Performance benchmarking

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 003 completed (output formatting to test)
- [ ] Task 002 completed (API integration to test)
- [ ] testify framework available in go.mod
- [ ] Access to GitHub repository for integration testing

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 1-2 hours
- Parallel: true (can run alongside enhanced features)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All unit tests pass with `go test ./...`
- [ ] Integration tests successfully validate end-to-end functionality
- [ ] Performance tests confirm < 2 second execution time
- [ ] Error handling tests cover all failure scenarios
- [ ] Test coverage meets quality standards (>80%)
- [ ] All edge cases are handled gracefully
- [ ] Tests can run in CI/CD pipeline successfully
