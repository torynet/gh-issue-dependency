# Task: Initialize Go module and project structure

## Description
Create the foundational Go project structure following gh-sub-issue patterns exactly. Initialize the Go module with proper dependencies and create the directory layout that mirrors gh-sub-issue's organization.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Go module initialized with correct module path `github.com/torynet/gh-issue-dependency`
- [ ] go.mod contains exact dependency versions from gh-sub-issue: cobra v1.7.0, go-gh/v2 v2.4.0, testify v1.8.4
- [ ] Directory structure created: cmd/, pkg/, tests/
- [ ] Basic .gitignore file for Go projects
- [ ] README.md with project description and installation instructions
- [ ] LICENSE file (MIT license)

## Technical Details
- **Implementation approach**: Mirror gh-sub-issue directory structure exactly
- **Key considerations**: Use Go 1.19+ features, ensure cross-platform compatibility
- **Code locations**: Root directory structure, go.mod, go.sum

Directory structure to create:
```
gh-issue-dependency/
├── main.go                      # (will be created in next task)
├── cmd/                         # Command implementations
├── pkg/                         # Shared utilities and types  
├── go.mod                       # Go module definition
├── go.sum                       # (will be generated)
├── README.md                    # Project documentation
├── LICENSE                      # MIT license
├── .gitignore                   # Go-specific gitignore
└── tests/                       # Integration tests
```

## Dependencies
- [ ] Go 1.19+ installed in development environment
- [ ] Git repository initialized
- [ ] Access to gh-sub-issue repository for pattern reference

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 2-3 hours
- Parallel: false (blocks all other tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Project builds successfully with `go build`
- [ ] Dependencies resolve correctly with `go mod tidy`
- [ ] Directory structure matches gh-sub-issue layout
- [ ] README explains project purpose and basic usage
- [ ] All files committed to git repository
