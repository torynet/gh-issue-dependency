# Task: Implement main.go and root command structure

## Description
Create the entry point (main.go) and root command (cmd/root.go) following gh-sub-issue patterns exactly. Establish the foundation for Cobra CLI framework with proper exit code handling and help system.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] main.go implements clean delegation to cmd.Execute() with exit code handling
- [ ] cmd/root.go sets up root command with proper help text and description
- [ ] Root command follows gh CLI naming conventions: "gh-issue-dependency"
- [ ] Help output matches gh CLI format and style
- [ ] Global --repo flag implemented for cross-repository operations
- [ ] Version information displayed in help
- [ ] Proper error handling for command execution failures

## Technical Details
- **Implementation approach**: Replicate gh-sub-issue main.go and cmd/root.go exactly
- **Key considerations**: No business logic in main(), proper Cobra initialization
- **Code locations**: main.go, cmd/root.go

Key patterns to replicate from gh-sub-issue:
- Clean main() function that only calls cmd.Execute()
- Root command setup with Use, Short, Long descriptions
- Global flags registration and validation
- Help text formatting following gh CLI standards

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 completed (project structure exists)
- [ ] Cobra framework available in go.mod
- [ ] Understanding of gh-sub-issue root command patterns

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 3-4 hours
- Parallel: false (blocks command implementation)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] `go run main.go --help` displays proper help information
- [ ] `go run main.go --version` shows version information
- [ ] Exit codes work correctly (0 for success, 1 for errors)
- [ ] Global --repo flag is recognized and validated
- [ ] Code follows exact patterns from gh-sub-issue
- [ ] Help text follows standard gh CLI formatting
