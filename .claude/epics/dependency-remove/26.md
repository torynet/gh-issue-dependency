# Task: Create comprehensive testing and validation suite

## Description
Implement comprehensive testing coverage including unit tests for validation logic, relationship removal testing, confirmation system testing, and end-to-end integration testing. Focus on testing safety features, error scenarios, and integration with GitHub API patterns from other dependency commands.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit tests for all validation functions with comprehensive edge cases
- [ ] Relationship existence verification testing with mocked GitHub responses
- [ ] Confirmation system testing including dry run and force scenarios
- [ ] API integration tests with mocked GitHub deletion endpoints
- [ ] End-to-end integration tests with real GitHub repositories
- [ ] Error handling tests for all validation and API failure scenarios
- [ ] Safety feature tests ensuring confirmation prompts prevent accidents
- [ ] Test coverage report showing adequate coverage (>80%)

## Technical Details
- **Implementation approach**: Table-driven tests following gh-sub-issue patterns with comprehensive safety and error scenario coverage
- **Key considerations**: Safety feature validation, error scenario testing, API mocking
- **Code locations**: cmd/remove_test.go, pkg/validation_test.go, pkg/github_test.go, tests/integration_test.sh

Critical test scenarios:

**Validation Logic Tests**:
```go
func TestRelationshipExistenceValidation(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name               string
        source             IssueRef
        target             IssueRef
        relType            string
        mockDependencies   []Dependency
        expectExists       bool
        expectError        bool
    }{
        {
            name:             "existing blocked-by relationship",
            source:           IssueRef{Owner: "owner", Repo: "repo", Number: 123},
            target:           IssueRef{Owner: "owner", Repo: "repo", Number: 45},
            relType:          "blocked-by",
            mockDependencies: []Dependency{{IssueID: 45, Type: "blocked-by"}},
            expectExists:     true,
            expectError:      false,
        },
        {
            name:             "non-existent relationship",
            source:           IssueRef{Owner: "owner", Repo: "repo", Number: 123},
            target:           IssueRef{Owner: "owner", Repo: "repo", Number: 45},
            relType:          "blocks",
            mockDependencies: []Dependency{{IssueID: 67, Type: "blocked-by"}},
            expectExists:     false,
            expectError:      false,
        },
        {
            name:        "API error during verification",
            source:      IssueRef{Owner: "owner", Repo: "repo", Number: 123},
            target:      IssueRef{Owner: "owner", Repo: "repo", Number: 45},
            relType:     "blocked-by",
            expectError: true,
        },
        // More test cases...
    }
    
    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            // Test implementation
        })
    }
}
```

**Safety Feature Tests**:
```go
func TestConfirmationSystem(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name          string
        dryRun        bool
        force         bool
        userResponse  string
        expectExecute bool
        expectOutput  string
    }{
        {
            name:          "dry run shows preview only",
            dryRun:        true,
            expectExecute: false,
            expectOutput:  "Would remove:",
        },
        {
            name:          "force skips confirmation",
            force:         true,
            expectExecute: true,
        },
        {
            name:          "user confirms removal",
            userResponse:  "y",
            expectExecute: true,
        },
        {
            name:          "user cancels removal",
            userResponse:  "n",
            expectExecute: false,
        },
        // More scenarios...
    }
}
```

**API Integration Tests**:
```go
func TestDependencyDeletion(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name           string
        source         IssueRef
        target         IssueRef
        relType        string
        mockResponse   *http.Response
        expectError    bool
        expectedError  string
    }{
        {
            name:         "successful deletion",
            source:       IssueRef{Owner: "owner", Repo: "repo", Number: 123},
            target:       IssueRef{Owner: "owner", Repo: "repo", Number: 45},
            relType:      "blocked-by",
            mockResponse: &http.Response{StatusCode: 204},
            expectError:  false,
        },
        {
            name:          "permission denied",
            mockResponse:  &http.Response{StatusCode: 403},
            expectError:   true,
            expectedError: "permission",
        },
        {
            name:          "relationship not found",
            mockResponse:  &http.Response{StatusCode: 404},
            expectError:   true,
            expectedError: "not found",
        },
        // More error scenarios...
    }
}
```

**Integration Test Scenarios**:
- Command execution with valid dependency removal
- Dry run mode validation and preview accuracy
- Confirmation prompt behavior in interactive and non-interactive modes
- Error handling for all failure types (validation, API, permission)
- Cross-repository dependency removal (when supported)
- Flag validation and mutual exclusion enforcement

- [ ] All unit tests pass with `go test ./...`
- [ ] Relationship existence verification tested with complex scenarios
- [ ] Confirmation system prevents accidental deletions in all test scenarios
- [ ] API integration tests validate proper error handling and success cases
- [ ] Safety features thoroughly tested (dry run, confirmation, force)
- [ ] Test coverage meets quality standards (>80%)
